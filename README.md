# Module-12-Plotly

## Outcome
* index.html : Customized webpage, Added image to jumbotran, changed font text color and added a description to bottom of page. I am only able to get this to work with terminal, navigating to folder and Python3 -m http.server
* app.js : Our d3.json metadata extracted from samples.json, using Plotly to Buildcharts for the Bar & bubble Charts. We also have our optionchanged so when user clicks on a new ID. Data in Charts are Dynamic. 
* Bonus.js: Our guage chart, its not exactly but its close enough.
